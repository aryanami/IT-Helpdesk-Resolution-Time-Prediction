# IT-Helpdesk-Resolution-Time-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for IT helpdesk ticket management by leveraging historical data to classify tickets and predict their resolution times. The primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and set realistic expectations for issue resolution, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Modern organizations depend on efficient ticket management systems to maintain seamless operations and ensure high customer satisfaction. Predicting the time required to resolve IT helpdesk tickets can significantly improve the management process. This project focuses on creating a statistical model to predict IT helpdesk ticket resolution times, helping organizations streamline their processes and allocate resources effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains IT Service Management data, including detailed information about incident tickets. Key features include:
- Ticket category
- Priority
- Severity
- Requestor details

These features were utilized to train and test the predictive model.

## Challenges
1. **Missing Values**: Rows with missing data were removed to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the dataset.
2. **Inconsistent Values**: Inconsistencies, such as non-numeric entries, were standardized to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
3. **Noisy Data**: Outliers were identified and removed using Z-score analysis to reduce noise in the data.
4. **Complex Data Relationships**: Multiple factors influencing resolution time were managed through careful data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed rows with null values and outliers to ensure a clean and reliable dataset.
2. **Standardization**: Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform feature influence across the model.
3. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted categorical data to numeric values to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
4. **Encoding**: Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding techniques to handle categorical features.
5. **Feature Selection**: Utilized correlation matrices and feature importance plots to select the most relevant features for the model.

## Models Used
Three different regression models were employed and compared for performance:
1. **Multi-Linear Regression (MLR)**
2. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
3. **Random Forest Regression (RF)**

Among these, the **Random Forest Regression** model outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 77%, making it the chosen model for further analysis and deployment.

## Why Random Forest?
- **Handles Non-Linear Relationships**: Random Forest is well-suited for capturing complex, non-linear relationships between features.
- **Robust Against Overfitting**: The ensemble learning approach of Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting, especially in large datasets.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Provides insights into feature importance, aiding in model interpretability and further optimization.
- **High Generalizability**: Exhibits strong generalization capabilities when applied to unseen data, making it reliable in real-world scenarios.

## Results
The model effectively predicts IT helpdesk ticket resolution times, as validated against a test dataset. These predictions can support better management of ticket assignment, improving resource allocation and customer satisfaction by setting realistic expectations for resolution times.
